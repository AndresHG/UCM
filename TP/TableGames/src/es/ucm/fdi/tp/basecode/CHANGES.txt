** 2nd REVISION

 1. Visibility of field dim of ConnectNFactory/ConnectNRules has been changed
    to 'protected'.
 
    # This change does not affect you.
 
 2. Signature of method 'evaluate' in GameRules has been changed, it has one 
    more argument now.
 
    # In your factories, you have to add the fourth argument of evaluate. It 
      should not affect you since we have not used it yet.
   
 3. GameFactory interface now implements java.io.Serializable
 
    # You will get some warnings in the classes the implement this interface, 
      asking to add a serializeId, etc.
 
 4. Added AIPlayer that uses an AIAlgorithm. Modified createAIPlayer of ConnectNFactory 
    to use (a subclass of) this player if the provided algorithm is
    not null. Implemented a simple evaluate method for ConnectN.
    
    # This change does not affect you.

 5. The package name connectN has been converted to lower-case.

    # You will need to update code that relies on this package

 6. Minor spelling fixes and enum name changes in Main

    # This change does not affect you, although you may wish to make similar
      changes to your code.

 7. Fixed broken advanced-tick-tack-toe functionality

    # This change does not affect your code, but it may come in as an
      inspiration to improve your P4 code.
